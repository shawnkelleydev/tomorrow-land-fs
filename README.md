# Tomorrow Land

Welcome to TomorrowLand, a full-stack budgeting application!

This project is actively under construction, so tread carefully.

Also, because TomorrowLand is currently using SQLite3, it is advised to clone the project and run the api on your local machine.  SQLite3 and Heroku do not get along.

To successfully use your local host, simply go to client/src/components/App.js and switch out the url (comment out the Heroku url and expose the localhost url).

To launch the project, run "npm start" in both the api and client directories.

This project uses a React front end and Node/Express/Sequelize backend.
